#Building Recommendation Engines
This is the code repository for [Building Recommendation Engines](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/building-recommendation-engines?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781785884856), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
A recommendation engine (sometimes referred to as a recommender system) is a tool that lets algorithm developers predict what a user may or may not like among a list of given items. Recommender systems have become extremely common in recent years, and are applied in a variety of applications. The most popular ones are movies, music, news, books, research articles, search queries, social tags, and products in general.


##Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
export MAHOUT_HOME = /home/softwares/ apache-mahout-distribution-0.12.2
export MAHOUT_LOCAL = true #for standalone mode
export PATH = $MAHOUT_HOME/bin
export CLASSPATH = $MAHOUT_HOME/lib:$CLASSPATH
```

To get started with different implementations of recommendation engines in R, Python,
Spark, Neo4j, Mahout we need the following software:
